# Microorganism-Computer-Vision

Deep Computer Vision ðŸ¦  - Analysis of the motion of microorganisms

## TODO (Deadline: February 30th, 2025)

- âœ… Find videos of microorganisms
    - âœ… Download and extract them
- âœ… Optical Flow
    - âœ… Check the associated vector field
    - Plot the vector field with a quiver plot
- Cluster entities
    - âœ… Compute the image gradient and optical flow gradient for each frame
        - Deduce clusters
    - âœ… Object detection on each frame 
    - âœ… Kalman Filter to ensure tracking (bbox id)
    - âœ… Visualize the entities in the video
- Motion analysis
    - âœ… Create the time series
        - Depends on the information we can extract from the microorganisms
            - E.g., Salmonella
    - Propose diffusion hypotheses (e.g., Gaussian Random Walk)
    - Perform statistical tests

- Experimental:
    - Simulate videos to train a segmentation model
